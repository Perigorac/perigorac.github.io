# BeeMW : an all-in-one embedded system for beehive monitoring

As students in embedded systems engineering, our school projet in late 2023 was to build a beehive monitoring system.  So, we came up with BEEMW.

## An embedded solution

BeeMW is contained withing a 80x360mm waterproof box, outfitted with many sensors to be placed in and around a beehive. These include a large metal chassis housing the weight scale, a portable camera in its separate box, and an array of wire-mounted sensors. The system is powered by a LiPo battery, one that is recharged by a solar cell, mounted with a light sensor. Thus, BeeMW can monitor three different temperatures, the hive's interior humidity, weight, interior sound, outdoor illumination, and can detect the presence of hornets with its camera.

## Low-power communications

BeeMW uses LoRaWAN, a French communication protocol, to send data over to the user. There is a LoRa antenna near the beehive array, which transmits data to a [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) server. Using TTN's open tools, we have developed a webhook that automatically forward data to the Dutch [BEEP](https://beep.nl/) platform, on which the data is displayed, on a variety of charts and graphs.
As the LoRa technology was designed for embedded systems, it has a low power consumption and requires a small antenna. However, it also has a low bitrate and limited airtime : this is why BeeMW only sends the most important informations possible : for example sound samples are treated locally and sent as a handful of spectral densities. Moreover, data is sent every 20 minutes - and in the meantime, all of the sensors aren't operating : their power is cut by the TPL5110, which is restored whenever the MKRWAN board awakes from its sleep cycle. Using Arduino's [Low Power](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoLowPower) library, we added an even more power-efficient, clock-accurate sleep mode.

BeeMW is integrated on a [PCB](./bmw_pcb.cad) made with [Kicad 6.0](https://www.kicad.org/).  

### Software information

All of the code, including the main loop and BEEMW's functionalities as standalone snippets of code, are available on [this repo](https://github.com/MathisVermeren/Open-Ruche-Project-SE-Polytech2023).

### Embedded AI for object recognition

![BEEMW Embedded AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perigorac/perigorac.github.io/main/BEEMW/ressources/BEEMW_EdgeImpulse.png)
BEEMW comes with an embedded AI model made with a free plan on [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/). We used a too short dataset of three hornet attacks videos sampled in [190 pictures](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNH1SHzrcbiPGDbbbSlf3vAYlcvsxEYMmPv_WKn9kv4QbVlJMErp1ut0Bl4b8iTBg?pli=1&key=Uno2Tlo1VExzSWwyTDFfSDJNSzZoY01VSGxLQ1Zn) plus a [free Dataset found on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/use-case-asian-hornet-detection/asian-hornet-detection-a6ael/dataset/2).
Sadly, in real conditions the AI model isn't accurate enough. We recommand building a new dataset for a real implementation and maybe go for a pro plan on Edge Impulse to allow more training cycles.
Because of its bad accuracy, we choose to not integrate the AI model in the final prototype, but we wrote [the code](https://github.com/MathisVermeren/Open-Ruche-Project-SE-Polytech2023/tree/master/camera/Final) and the communication system between the ESP32 and the Arduino. You will find a Readme explaining the communication system, a code for the ESP32 , a code to recieve the data on the Arduino and an example to use it with a BEEP integration and with all sensors.
